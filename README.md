# Email-Spam-Ham-Detection

#### In this project, we build a spam detector using 5 Machine Learning models and evaluate them with test data using different performance metrics used. The dataset we used was from real emails from Enron  containing both spam and ham emails in different proportions. As per our analysis, Naive Bayes model and SVM worked well for spam detection among the 5 models

### Dataset Used :- The Enron Email 

Dataset Description:- This is one of the biggest email data sources in the world. Almost half a million files spread over 2.5 GB. Normally, emails are very sensitive, and rarely released to the public, but because of the shocking nature of Enronâ€™s collapse, everything was released to the public.
